## In the Garden of Eden: A Maze Game
Eve rushes to the apple tree, overflowing with fruit, after hearing of its capability to bring forth knowledge on what is good and evil. Every apple collected along the way increases her knowledge and only by reaching the tree can she satisfy her greed. At the end of each turn, a clock lies in wait which reduces the time it takes for Eve to reach her destination. How fast can she reach the apple tree and how many apples can she collect at the shortest possible time?
